# Strafe-Optimizer

Enhance player movement precision by generating perfectly accurate strafes.

### Features
- Enhanced Movement Precision: Generates strafes with 100% accuracy, allowing players to smoothly navigate through in-game environments.
- Mouse-Direction Mapping: Dynamically detects mouse movement and accurately triggers 'a' and 'd' key presses accordingly, enabling simple movement control

### Disclaimer
- Non-Compatible Games: Games that utilize proprietary input methods and are not compatible with direct input or virtual key presses are not supported. Code can be refractor in ways to bypass this, but not without risking cheating bans.
